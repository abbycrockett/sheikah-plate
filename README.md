### Development Process
I created this project for fun, to experiment with Cursor for the first time, and to practice UI/UX design using Figma. I heavily referenced the [Game UI database](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/) for both botw and totk. Some of the UI elements assets came from [Hunter Paramore’s Figma kit](https://admiregd.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-ui-kit). Inkscape helped me trace in-game art for the Add Recipe screen so I could recolor it as a vector image. The style ended up being a mix of the Sheikah Slate and the Purah Pad.
