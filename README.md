# Sheikah Plate

A Zelda inspired recipe book app that runs in the browser.

I created this project for fun to experiment with Cursor and practice UI/UX design using Figma. It’s not meant to be practical, but it’s been really enjoyable to tinker with. So far I have enjoyed using Cursor and will update this README later lol
