# Sheikah Plate

A Zelda inspired recipe book app that runs in the browser.

I created this project for fun to experiment with Cursor and used Figma to plan the UI design. It's not practical in the slightest but its gratifying to fiddle with. So far I have enjoyed using Cursor and will update this README later lol

It's important to note, if you clear "cookies and site data" you will lose all of your recipes. Right now my website is riddled with bugs and needs stylistic updates.
